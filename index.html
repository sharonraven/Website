    <p>I am a stay at home mom to 4 kids three boys and one girl, 2 are adults 1 will be turning 19 in September of this year 2020.  Me and my husband lived in a 5 bedroom house with our 4 kids in Vancouver, BC.  We have since moved into a smaller place and only 2 kids at home now.</p>
  <h3>Laundry Detergent Savings</h3>

  <p>So one day I noticed how much garbage we get just from laundry, bottles of laundry detergent and a bottle for bleach and a bottle for fabric softner, I did not like that we created so much garbage from a simple thing like laundry.</p>
  <p>I am more mindful of the garbage we create since <a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver.aspx" target="_blank">our city is a green city,</a> and I dont want to leave a big heaping dump for my kids to deal with in the future.  So I decided to research about laundry detergent alternatives, since that was the first thing I noticed was all the garbage from that in our household.</p>
  <p>So I started to check out other laundry brands like one that has a brightener in the detergent so no need for bleach, or dryer sheets instead of liquid fabric softner.  I did not like the dryer sheets, they lost scent once you opened the box then you had garbage from the sheets.  Plus once in a while we hang dry our clothes to dry and can't use dryer sheets that way and would still need fabric softner and thats more garbage.</p>
  <p>So still trying to research for more ideas and I came across a YouTube video that someone made their own liquid laundry detergent and it lasts them about a year well that got my attention good, I watched the video and was amazed how she did that, but you needed multiple containers for the liquid or use old laundry bottles which I did not want to be responsible for creating more garbage again.</p>
  <p>So I did some more research and some people stored their soap in a clear bin or glass drink dispensers with boys around I didnt feel comfortable with a big glass container around lol moms of boys ya know why.</p>
  <p>So I stopped searching for a while, and someone on my Facebook shared a video on make your own laundry soap and it was all powder not liquid!  I was so happy I researched the ingredients and seemed way better and cheaper in the long run, and I didn't need a big container for it like the liquid.  So off I went to see if we could find the ingredients and we did except for one ingredient was a bit tricky to find but we found a replacement a sunlight laundry soap bar, did you know those were a thing, not me I was surprised.</p>
  <p>So we made the soap and you only need 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons of the detergent for your laundry well I was shocked and was hoping it would work.  First load worked great! And it smelled fresh and clean, we still used dryer sheets wanted to finish what we had before I found something else to replace it.  I researched and some used vinegar and essential oils in the rinse cycle, just having to buy a different jug again creating garbage.</p>
  <p>I tried the essential oils in the rinse and didnt work it all rinsed away. Then the scent booster beads came out, you use them during wash and you dont need to listen for your rinse cycle to make sure you get your softner in.  So we bought one and it works great its a bit too strong for us so we used way less then it says to use on the bottle.</p>
  <p>So now we have replaced the softner also just a way smaller bottle for garbage, we might try the wool dryer balls with essential oils later, we used to hang our clothes too so dryer sheets werent always good for us either. So the scent beads work good for now and space saving for garbage but still creating garbage.</p>
  <p>What we use to make our own Laundry Detergent:</p>
  <p>Borax about half the box, arm & hammer washing soda about half the box same size as borax about, regular baking soda about 1 regular box or 2 boxes upto you, oxi clean powder we put about one quarter of the container into the mix, and a bar of sunlight laundry soap you have to grate the soap.  Mix all together in your container and use. Lasts us about a year and you still have product left over from your ingredients to make another batch or 2 and you dont have to buy more ingredients for about another 2 years.</p>
